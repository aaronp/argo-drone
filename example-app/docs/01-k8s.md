# Kubernetes

## What
In essence, kubernetes is a technology (specification and accompanying tools) which enable developers to treat clusters of machines as single ball of compute -- memory, storage and compute.

# Why

* It allows us to specify in a cloud-agnostic way how we want to deploy our applications, and gives us a portable means for those applications to coordinate/communicate with each other.

* It's tooling also allows developers to run/test things locally (using local clusters such as "kubernetes in docker" or "[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/" or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/))

* It also provides mechanisms for simplifying application architecture through common patterns such as ["sidecars"](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/kubernetes-learn-sidecar-container-pattern-6d8c21f873d)

* It Empowers an ecosystem for deploying applications, as well as "GitOps" through the likes of [argocd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
